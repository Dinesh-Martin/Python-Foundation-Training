The only place on Earth where this could happen is near the North Pole. 
If a bear is able to walk one mile south, then one mile east, and then one mile north to return to the same starting point, 
it means the path forms a closed loop. This phenomenon occurs near the North Pole due to the way longitudinal lines converge.

Since the only bears found in the Arctic region (near the North Pole) are polar bears, the color of the bear would be white.
