Step 1: Identify the Letters
The phrase "new door" consists of the letters:

N, E, W, D, O, O, R
Step 2: Check for Possible Words
Since we need to rearrange these letters to form one meaningful word, we start by thinking of possible combinations.

Step 3: Try Logical Rearrangements
Let's rearrange the letters systematically:

Look at common prefixes or suffixes:
"New" and "Door" seem separate, but mixing them might help.
Rearranging:
N E W D O O R
Try grouping vowels (E, O, O) and consonants (N, W, D, R).
Think of a phrase: "One Word".
Step 4: Confirm the Answer
Rearranging N, E, W, D, O, O, R, we get:
"one word"
