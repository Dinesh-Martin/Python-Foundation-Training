To minimize the total travel distance for all students, we need to find the optimal location for the school along the straight-line path between towns A and B.

Step 1: Define Variables
Let the school be located x km from town A along the straight-line path toward town B.
Town A is at 0 km, and town B is at 3 km.
Students in A = 100, and students in B = 50.
Step 2: Minimize the Weighted Distance
The total travel distance is given by:

Total Distance=(100×x)+(50×(3−x))

100−50=0

100x=50(3−x)

100x+50x=150

150x=150

x=1


Conclusion:
The school should be built 1 km from town A along the direct path to town B to minimize the total travel distance of all students.
