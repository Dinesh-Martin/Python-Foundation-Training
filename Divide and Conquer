Divide and Conquer Approach for Sorting the List:
The Divide and Conquer method is commonly used in sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Quick Sort. Let's use Merge Sort to sort the list [6, 5, 1, 4, 3, 2].

Step 1: Divide
We recursively divide the list into smaller sublists until each contains only one element.

[6, 5, 1, 4, 3, 2]


Divide into two halves:

[6, 5, 1]    [4, 3, 2]


Divide again:

[6, 5]  [1]    [4, 3]  [2]

Keep dividing:

[6] [5]  [1]    [4] [3]  [2]

Now, all sublists contain single elements.

Step 2: Conquer (Merge)
We now merge them back in sorted order.

Merge [6] and [5] → [5, 6]
Merge [4] and [3] → [3, 4]
Merge [5, 6] and [1] → [1, 5, 6]
Merge [3, 4] and [2] → [2, 3, 4]
Merge [1, 5, 6] and [2, 3, 4] → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]



Final Sorted List:


[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
